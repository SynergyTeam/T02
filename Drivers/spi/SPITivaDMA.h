 *
 *  @brief      SPI driver implementation for a TivaSPIcontroller using
 *              the micro DMA controller.
 *
 *  The SPI header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SPI.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/spi/SPITivaDMA.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  This SPI driver implementation is designed to operate on a Tiva SPI
 *  controller using a micro DMA controller.
 *
 *  ## SPI Chip Select #
 *  This SPI controller supports a hardware chip select pin. Refer to the
 *  device's user manual on how this hardware chip select pin behaves in regards
 *  to the SPI frame format.
 *
 *  <table>
 *  <tr>
 *  <th>Chip select type</th>
 *  <th>SPI_MASTER mode</th>
 *  <th>SPI_SLAVE mode</th>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Hardware chip select</td>
 *  <td>No action is needed by the application to select the peripheral.</td>
 *  <td>See the device documentation on it's chip select requirements.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Software chip select</td>
 *  <td>The application is responsible to ensure that correct SPI slave is
 *      selected before performing a SPI_transfer().</td>
 *  <td>See the device documentation on it's chip select requirements.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  ## DMA Interrupts #
 *  This driver is designed to operation on a micro DMA. The micro DMA generates
 *  IRQ on the perpheral's interrupt vector. This implementation automatically
 *  installs a DMA aware Hwi (interrupt) to service the assigned micro DMA
 *  channels.
 *
 *  ## Scratch Buffers #
 *  A uint32_t scratch buffer is used to allow SPI_transfers where txBuf or rxBuf
 *  are NULL. Rather than requiring txBuf or rxBuf to have a dummy buffer of size
 *  of the transfer count, a single DMA accessible uint32_t scratch buffer is used.
 *  When rxBuf is NULL, the uDMA will transfer all the SPI data receives into the
 *  scratch buffer as a "bit-bucket".
 *  When rxBuf is NULL, the scratch buffer is initialized to defaultTxBufValue
 *  so the uDMA will send some known value.
 *  Each SPI driver instance should uses its own scratch buffer.
 *
 *  ## SPI data frames #
 *
 *  SPI data frames can be any size from 4-bits to 16-bits. If the dataSize in
 *  ::SPI_Params is greater that 8-bits, then the SPITivaDMA driver
 *  implementation will assume that the ::SPI_Transaction txBuf and rxBuf
 *  point to an array of 16-bit uint16_t elements.
 *
 *  dataSize  | buffer element size |
 *  --------  | ------------------- |
 *  4-8 bits  | uint8_t             |
 *  9-16 bits | uint16_t            |
 *
 *  ## DMA transfer size limit #
 *
 *  The Tiva micro DMA contoller only supports data transfers of upto 1024
 *  data frames. A data frame can be 4 to 16 bits in length.
 *
 *  ## DMA accessible memory #
 *
 *  As this driver uses uDMA to transfer data/from data buffers, it is the
 *  responsibility of the application to ensure that theses buffers reside in
 *  memory that is accessible by the DMA.
 *
 *  For example, on Concerto devices local SRAM C0 and C1 are NOT accessible the
 *  DMA.
